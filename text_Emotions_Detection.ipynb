        "Emotion is the state of mind that is aligned with feelings, and thoughts usually directed toward a specific object. Emotion is a behavior that reflects personal significance or opinion regarding the interaction we have with other human beings or related to a certain event. The human being is able to identify the emotions from textual data and can understand the matter of the text. But if you think about the machines, can they able to identify the emotions from the text?\r\n",

        "Text2emotion is the python package developed with the clear intension to find the appropriate emotions embedded in the text data. The research says that when the human is in the thinking process and he is damn sure about his statement then he will express his emotions in the right context of manner and it will be proper aligned in case of words expressing those emotions.\r\n",
        "If I want to tell you in simple words then consider if the customer did not like the product by investing the large amount then he will surely give his feedback like “I am very angry by your product services and gonna file a complaint regarding this issue”. When you read this kind of feedback then you will be sure that the customer is completely angry about product services and we have to improve it as soon as possible. Text2emotion works, in the same manner, to extract the emotions from the text.\r\n",
